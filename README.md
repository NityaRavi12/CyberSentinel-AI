# CyberSentinel AI - Advanced Cybersecurity AI System
Autonomous Threat Intake & Triage Agent (ATITA)

"Empowering cybersecurity with intelligent threat detection and autonomous response using cutting-edge machine learning and agentic AI."

🚀 Overview
CyberSentinel AI - Autonomous Threat Intake & Triage Agent (ATITA) is a sophisticated, production-ready cybersecurity system that combines traditional machine learning with modern agentic AI to autonomously detect, analyze, and respond to digital threats. The system features a multi-agent architecture powered by advanced ML models and optional LLM integration for intelligent reasoning.

Escalation Agent - Manages human intervention decisions
Memory Agent - Stores case history and enables continuous learning
🧠 Advanced Machine Learning Models
Threat Classification Model - TF-IDF + Random Forest for threat type detection
Severity Assessment Model - ML-based severity prediction with feature engineering
Anomaly Detection Model - Isolation Forest for detecting unusual threat patterns
NLP Model - Sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and text embeddings
